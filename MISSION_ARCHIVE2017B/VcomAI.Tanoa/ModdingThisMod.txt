Hello!

If you are looking to modify VcomAI I have only one thing to say to you...


Please do!


And if you make something really cool, or optimize something really neat-o like, then please send it my way or
post it on the forums (if you are so willing). I have a firm belief that scripts like these can only become better
with community support. I am just a single person and do this as a hobby, there are many people in this community who
know much more than I do. SO, please feel free to contribute to the project.

Thank you,

Genesis
