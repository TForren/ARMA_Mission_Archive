0) How will we trigger the function? How will we know that the AI should be CONSIDERING
grabbing more ammo?

1) Determine Low Ammo
-Percentage?
-Completely out?

2) Find nearby ammo sources
-How to know that the ammo matches?
-AT capabilities?
-Having it be configurable (On/off)
-Efficency? Can we really consider EVERY ammo type? How stressful on the engine is that?

3) Determine if it is safe to grab ammo.
- Threshold of ammo = wait until safe. When at 0 ammo -> get ammo NOW.
- What is 'safe' for AI? How will they know it's safe?

4) Grab ammo for weapons -> soldierOne action ["rearm", ammoTruckOne];


IDEALLY:Rearm primary, secondary, AT/AA, OR/AND grab AT/AA.
