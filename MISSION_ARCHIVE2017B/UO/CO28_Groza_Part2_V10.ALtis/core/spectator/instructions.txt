ASP Install Instructions:

1. Place the "vip_cmn" and "vip_asp" folders in the ROOT of your mission folder. If "vip_cmn" already exists, use whichever folder is the latest version.


2. In the mission's Description.ext, add (or insert into the appropriate classes, if they already exist):

	#include "vip_cmn\resource\vip_dlg_defaults.hpp"
	#include "vip_asp\resource\vip_asp_dlg.hpp"

	class CfgFunctions {

		#include "vip_cmn\fn\vip_cmn_fnc.hpp"
		#include "vip_asp\fn\vip_asp_fnc.hpp"
	};


	class rscTitles {
	
		#include "vip_asp\resource\vip_asp_rscTitles.hpp"
	};


3. Again in description.ext, make sure that
	
	respawn=3;

or

	respawn="BASE";

otherwise ASP won't work. It's also recommended to assign "respawnDelay" a number. 


4. It's not necessary to create "respawn_west", etc, markers.


5. Execution:

a) The parameters for spectator are: whether to start the camera immediately, whether to track unit movement, whether to spectate AI, and optionally have an establishing shot. The establishing shot is in world coordinates. Examples:

Activate when player dies, unit tracking off, AI off, no establishing shot:

	["Init"] call compile preprocessFileLinenumbers "vip_asp\vip_asp_init.sqf"; 

Activate when player dies, unit tracking on, AI on, establishing shot:

	["Init", [true, true, [3200, 1400, 50]]] call compile preprocessFileLinenumbers "vip_asp\vip_asp_init.sqf";

Activate immediately (e.g. for spectator slot), unit tracking on, AI off, no establishing shot:

	["Start", [true]] call compile preprocessFileLinenumbers "vip_asp\vip_asp_init.sqf"; 


b) If you simply wish to use the camera for photography, either in the debug console, or in a script, use:

	["Init"] call vip_asp_fnc_cl_newCamera;


Spectate can of course be activated by different means (for instance, in a mission where players can respawn back into the field), but that is not covered here. Look into the documentation for vip_asp_fnc_cl_newCamera.
