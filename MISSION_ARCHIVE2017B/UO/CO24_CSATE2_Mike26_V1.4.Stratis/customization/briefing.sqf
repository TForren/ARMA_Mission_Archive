NEWTAB("I. Situation:")
We have successfully extracted from the Zaros solar power plant on Altis. On our way back to Stratis, Griffin (our command element) informed us that the AAF started invading Stratis and that there is fighting going on at the airfield.<br/>
A UAV revealed that a mechanized platoon was heading towards Mike-26 right before it was shot down. Griffin requested that we defend Mike-26 from the AAF to keep the radar staion online for as long as possible.
