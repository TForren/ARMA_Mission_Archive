_log_briefing=player createDiaryRecord["ais",["About wounding / death:","
- If a unit receives too much damage, the unit goes unconscious. This means that the unit starts to bleed out and needs help from other units.<br/>
- If someone comes to help, he can stop the bleeding and heal the wounded unit. The remaining damage after the first aid process depends on several factors (Was the attendant a medic? What kind of medical equipment was used?).<br/>
- If nobody comes to help the unit eventually bleeds out. The time depends on the amount of damage the unit received.<br>
- If you are not able to start the first aid process for some reason, you still have the option to press on the wound. While you are pressing on the wound, the unit will stop bleeding (increase lifetime).

<font face='PuristaMedium' size=30 color='#014EE3'>Psycho's Wounding System</font><br/><br/>
This First Aid System (AIS = Alternative Injury System) is an alternative system to all the current normal revive scripts.<br/><br/>
The main difference to a standard revive system is that the unit does not die before going into a state of agony. If critical damage level is reached, the unit goes unconscious and does not immediately die like in most other systems. The advantage: You can use it in missions without a revive option as well!<br/><br/>
Another advantage of the system is that if a unit is gravely wounded and waiting for others to help, the wounded unit is not completely defenseless. A wounded unit can go prone, crawl and use a weapon as last stand (until the magazine is empty).
AIS also supports AI. AI soldiers can be unconscious or give first aid as well.
