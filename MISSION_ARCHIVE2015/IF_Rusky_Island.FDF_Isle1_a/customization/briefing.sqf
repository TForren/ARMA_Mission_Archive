NEWTAB("Tactical Notes:")
-STONE-1's night vision is the most powerful tool at the BLUFOR's disposal. Using the bradley recklessy will put BLUFOR's only night vision at risk.
<br/>
-Note that infantry are equip with non-zoom optics. The Rifle squads will be most effectives up-close and in CQB. Try to get them into CQB as fast as possible before they are wiped out in long range engagements.

NEWTAB("Tactical Notes:")
The BlUFOR WILL have Night vision in their Bradley. Destroying it will remove their own night vision capability.
<br/>
<br/>Attempting to bottle neck the blufor at the land bridge with only 4 dudes wil likely get you spotted and eliminated. Putin's Finest need to operate carefully or be wiped out by the bradley.
<br/>
<br/>All Putin's Finest are equipt with long-range night vision optics. Most effective use of these spots is at mid to long range engagements with BLUFOR. keep your distance if you can.
