//This module allows you to set up the languages present for the mission and to set the languages spoken based on the side.

//This module also has a preinit function called [unit, languages] call FNC_SetLanguages; which allows you to set the languages of an individual unit using his init field.

//Example:
//[this, ["ru"]] call FNC_SetLanguages;
//[this, ["fr", "en", "ru"]] call FNC_SetLanguages;

//This is an example of Canadiens vs Russians
