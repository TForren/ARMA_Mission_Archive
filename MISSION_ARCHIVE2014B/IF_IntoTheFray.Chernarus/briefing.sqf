one of the UN FOBS is running dangerously low on munitions. Most likely because of how much 'target practice' they do out into the water. HQ is sending us to
deliver at least one ammunition truck to the FOB. ENDTAB;

A few trucks. We duct taped a 50 to one.<br />
Someone filled the fuel truck outside with some explosives we stole from the UN when they were asleep. Would make a wonderful explosion if destroyed.<br />

US supply convoy. possibly Light armor too. Fucking Americans.<br />
Probably high tech shit knowing them.<br />

NEWTAB("I. Situation:")
So apparently we took a bit too many of the UN's ammo a few nights back. Word is that they've called for a supply convoy to fill the empty space we made.<br /> 
Uhh...We have all the explosives we want so we could probably just blow up the supply convoy. Would be fun.
