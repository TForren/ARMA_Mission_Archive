Looks like an AAF commander has went full rogue. This means no AAF reinforcements. Unfortunately he iss doing business with the
 CSAT so we may have to worry about them on this one. Local authorities have informed us that this AAF commander evacuated the small town of
 Oreokastro and has made it into his own little castle of weapons. It looks like he raided an AAF armory before deciding the CSAT are the superior 
 choice. ENDTAB;
