"<br/>DESCRIPTION<br/>
===========<br/><br/>
ALiVE Insurgency is a throwback to the old Arma 2 Insurgency by Fireball+Pogoman<br/><br/>
Players must search houses to find random generated INTEL items to find enemy cache locations. Destroy 10 cache locations and win!<br/><br/>

<t size=2 align=left>How to play?</t><br/>
Search and clear the indicated red grids. When a grid is cleared it will turn green. Be sure to search the houses for randomly generated INTEL items. Picking up INTEL items will create a marker in the general area of a cache location. Find and destroy the cache.<br/><br/>
