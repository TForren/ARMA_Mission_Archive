If a unit recive to much damage the unit go in unconscious-mode. That means the unit start to bleed and need help from other units.
If someone come to help he can stop the bleeding and heal the unit. The rest damage after the first aid process depends on some things. (healer was a medic? medical equipment used?)<br/><br/>
If nobody come to help the unit bleed out after some time. The time depends on the strength of the units damage. If you cant start the first aid process of some reason you have the option to press on the wound. That means the unit stop to bleed until you release the press: (save lifetime)

This First Aid System (AIS = Alternative Injury System) is a alternative system to all the existitng normal revive scripts.<br/><br/>
The main difference to a standard revive system is that you arent be dead before you go in the agony state. If a critical damage level is reached the unit go unconscious without dieing before like in most other systems. The advantage: You can use it in missions without a revive option too!<br/><br/>
Another advantage of the system is that if you are heavy wounded and wait for others help you arent completely defenseless. You can roll on your belly and use your weapon again until the magazine is empty.
The ais also supports AI. That mean AI soldiers can be unconscious or can help you too.
