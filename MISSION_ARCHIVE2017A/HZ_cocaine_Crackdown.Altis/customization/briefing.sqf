NEWTAB("I. Situation:")
5 months into the NATO occupation of the Greek Island of Lemnos, occupying NATO forces have been skirmishing with rising Greek ultranationalist cells. The ultranationalists have been supported by a prominent Greek drug cartel, The Sons of Cypriot (SoC). Captializing on the lawless chaos of war-torn civilian populations, it is in the best interest of the Sons of Cypriot to support the ultranationalists to keep the local cocaine demand high. They have been the primary source of income for the ultranationalist cells.
<br/><br/>
British Armed Forces ARSENIC Company has been tasked with cutting off the source of income to the ultranationalists by targeting the Sons of Cypriot directly. Recent events have seen ARESENIC company ambushing and cornering both ultranationalist and Sons of Cypriot fighters on the Northern coasts of Lemnos during a massive drug trade. The fighting ultranationalists have been effectively eliminated by ARSENIC 1 on the western flank and ARSENIC 3 will begin engressing on the eastern flank. 
<br/>
<br/>
The final step is for ARSENIC 2 to finish off the remaining Sons of Cypriot before they extract the entire cocaine shipment.
